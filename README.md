## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using COVID-19 data from Kaggle to better understand:

1. What Are The Top 10 Countries In Terms Of Confirmed Cases And Fatalities?
2. What Are The Top States In Terms Of Confirmed Cases In China And US ?
3. Which Country Is Able To Control The Spread Of COVID-19 ?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found [here](https://medium.com/@siddhantsarkar_20435/covid-19-digging-a-bit-deeper-using-data-based-approach-49d3a01e1205?sk=67c01854c69de47114c2a2f4c03c5643).
